18
01:34.750 --> 01:37.750
How am I

19
01:37.500 --> 01:40.500
supposed to read your mind

20
01:40.500 --> 01:42.750
there were hints

21
01:42.750 --> 01:46.250
they are not enough

22
01:46.500 --> 01:48.790
you can ask for hints

23
01:48.790 --> 01:52.000
the game creators did not reply

24
01:53.000 --> 01:54.500
how do you expect

25
01:56.000 --> 01:57.750
me to play a guessing game

26
01:57.750 --> 02:00.500
it is impossible

27
02:00.500 --> 02:03.500
this is not real gameplay

32
02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
I even read

33
02:30.500 --> 02:34.000
all the look descriptions

34
02:34.500 --> 02:36.500
but I am still stuck

35
02:41.000 --> 02:42.500
.

36
02:43.000 --> 02:47.500
not every parser game

37
02:48.500 --> 02:53.000
have external help links

38
02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
why do you make

39
02:56.500 --> 02:59.750
such hard games

40
03:00.000 --> 03:02.500
that uses up so much time

41
03:04.750 --> 03:07.500
.

42
03:14.250 --> 03:16.250
I have not

43

completed the games

44
03:25.550 --> 03:26.750

45
03:31.500 --> 03:33.750
I am going to retry them

46
03:40.750 --> 03:46.250
I like the worldbuilding

47
03:46.500 --> 03:49.000
and the originality

48
03:53.750 --> 03:56.000
but..
